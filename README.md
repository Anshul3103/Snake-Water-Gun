# Snake-Water-Gun
This is a game that we all have played or use to play with our friends when we are free.

This game includes you as a user and the computer with whom you are going to play, so basically in this game some of the algorithms are included according to which the winner is decided.

The computer randomly generates his choice and asks you for you choice if you choose the same as computer then the game is drawn and if you enter some other input then the Winner is decided according to the below key points:

"Abbrevations: s for Snake, w for Water and g for Gun"
1. If you choose s and computer chooses w then you win as the snake will drink the water & vice-versa i.e. is you choose w and computer chooses s then you loose.
2. If you choose s and computer chooses g then you loose as the gun will shoot the snake and snake dies & vice-versa(vice-versa concept same as above).
3. If you choose g and computer chooses w then you loose as the gun will sink into the water and vice-versa(vice-versa concept same as above).

Thank you!!! :)
